## Files Description

### debugging/

- **change_background.html**: An interactive HTML page that allows users to change the background color using buttons and JavaScript.

- **checkbook.py**: A Python class implementing a simple checkbook system with deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking functionality.

- **factorial.py**: A Python script that calculates the factorial of a number using an iterative approach. Takes a command-line argument.

- **factorial_recursive.py**: A Python script that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive approach.

- **mines.py**: A Python implementation related to minesweeper game logic.

- **print_arguments.py**: A utility script that demonstrates how to handle and print command-line arguments in Python.

- **tic.py**: A Python implementation of a tic-tac-toe game.

## Usage

### Python Scripts

Most Python scripts can be run from the command line:

```bash
# Run factorial calculation
python3 debugging/factorial.py 5

# Run print arguments utility
python3 debugging/print_arguments.py arg1 arg2 arg3

# Run other Python scripts
python3 debugging/checkbook.py
python3 debugging/tic.py
python3 debugging/mines.py
```

### HTML Files

Open the HTML files in a web browser:

```bash
# Open in default browser
open debugging/change_background.html
# or
firefox debugging/change_background.html
```

## Learning Objectives

This project helps students learn to:

- Identify and debug common programming errors
- Use AI tools (ChatGPT) for debugging assistance
- Work with different programming languages and paradigms
- Practice systematic debugging approaches
- Understand common bug patterns in Python and web development

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A web browser (for HTML files)
- Basic understanding of Python and web development concepts
